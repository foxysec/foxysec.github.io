## General Help

```
help command
```
● [Basic]:

    clear          : clear cmd
    history        : show Foxy command history
    ls             : list files in current directory
    pwd            : print current directory
    cd <dir>       : open folder
    ping <host>    : ping host

● [Advanced]:
    list                : list avaliable payloads
    set payload <pn>    : set payload to start
    back                : back to Foxy

```
list command
```
- list command will show you avaliable payloads table.


**Here is the sample of** `foxy::net::port-scanner` **payload usage :**

Set payload to start :
```
[Foxy] > set payload foxy::net::port-scanner
```
`show` Command to see setted variables. (It is null at start.)
```

Set target to start exploit.
```
[foxy::net::port-scanner] > set target:5.2.84.221
```
Output will show you setted information :
```
target ==> 5.2.84.221
```
And you are ready to run (exploit) :
```
[foxy::net::port-scanner] > run
```
Output will be like this.
```
[*] Starting port scanning for 5.2.84.221.

	Port	Action	Service
	21	open	ftp
	80	open	http

This is just port scanner. You can use other payloads easily. Same logic. Use help command...
